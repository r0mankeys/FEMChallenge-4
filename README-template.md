## Overview

This challenge was both extremely exciting and daunting for me. I'd seen this challenge months ago near the end of 2022 and had started it then when I noticed the `data.json` file and read the part of the brief saying "you can use this file to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose", this immediatley caught my attention. I tried for days and couldn't figure out how I could possibly link the data of this file to my HTML, I then realised the problem was how limited my javascript knowledge was (at the time I didn't even know how imports worked properley, let alone modules)
