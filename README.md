## Overview

This challenge was both extremely exciting and daunting for me. I'd seen this challenge months ago near the end of 2022 and had started it then when I noticed the `data.json` file and read the part of the brief saying "you can use this file to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose", this immediatley caught my attention. I tried for days and couldn't figure out how I could possibly link the data of this file to my HTML, I then realised the problem was how limited my javascript knowledge was (at the time I didn't even know how imports worked properley, let alone modules). So I decided to take a productive break from project deployment and work on my skills through practice and learning throuh course (I'm currently taking a course provided by App Academy).

## My process

I approaced this project in a different way than I did with the other Front End Mentor challenges due to what I learned during my practice and my course. Instead of breaking the page up into sections in my head I did it on my iPad, really trying to visualize the code and write as much as I could before actually begining programming. That approach not only made things go much faster when I eventually started, but it also made me have much less questions and understand my grey areas much clearer. After I'd finished my version I watched **_[Kevin Powell's](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/about)_** version of the same challenge and while ours were very similar in essence to begin with his insights due to his experience definitley helped improve my CSS eye and make my project that much better from a refactoring stand point. I highly recommend you watch his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8).

### What I learned

Honestly I dont feel like I've neccessarily learned anything, exept the `@font-face` rule in CSS3 and that your project source files should be in the root directory if they rely on data in other directories (when deploying)

### Continued development

Modular programming has really caught my attention, I love the idea of using a logical programming languae to create and render data on websites which is why I plan to continue developing javascript projects with a Reactjs project coming very soon
